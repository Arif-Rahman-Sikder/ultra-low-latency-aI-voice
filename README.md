- `GET /api/metrics` - Performance metrics
- `POST /api/voice-process` - Voice processing
- `POST /api/forms` - Form submission

### Step 4: Start the Frontend Development Server

```bash
# In a new terminal window, start the frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173`

### Step 5: Access the Application

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Important**: Allow microphone permissions when prompted
3. Click "Start Chat" to access the conversational interface

|---------|----------------|
| "I want to fill a form" | Opens the form interface |
| "My name is John Smith" | Updates the name field |
| "My email is john@example.com" | Updates the email field |
| "Submit the form" | Submits the completed form |

## üß™ Testing & Performance

### Automated Performance Testing

The application includes built-in performance testing capabilities:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Run the performance tests:
   ```javascript
   window.performanceTester.runAllTests()
   ```

### Performance Targets

The application is optimized to meet these performance benchmarks:

- ‚úÖ **Voice Latency**: < 500ms consistently
- ‚úÖ **Form Updates**: < 100ms response time
- ‚úÖ **Audio Quality**: Clear and natural speech synthesis
- ‚úÖ **Interruption Capability**: Immediate response to stop commands
- ‚úÖ **Form Opening**: < 1 second from voice command

### Manual Testing Scenarios

1. **Voice Recognition Test**:
   - Click the microphone button
   - Speak clearly: "Hello, how are you?"
   - Verify the transcript appears and AI responds

2. **Form Integration Test**:
   - Say: "I want to fill a form"
   - Say: "My name is [Your Name]"
   - Say: "My email is [your-email@example.com]"
   - Say: "Submit the form"
   - Verify each step updates the form correctly

3. **Performance Monitor Test**:
   - Navigate to the Performance Monitor section
   - Click "Start Monitoring"
   - Observe real-time metrics updates
